                                    The jQuery community isn't something that you can read about to understand; it's 
something that you actually have to participate in for it to fully sink in. I hope that 
you'll have the opportunity to partake in it. Come join us in our forums, mailing 
lists, and blogs and let us help guide through the experience of getting to 
know jQuery better. 

For me, jQuery is much more than a block of code. It’s the sum of total experiences 
that have transpired over the years in order to make the library happen. The 
considerable ups and downs and the struggle of development together with the 
excitement of seeing it grow and succeed. Growing close with its users and fellow 
team members, understanding them and trying to grow and adapt. 

When I first saw this book talk about jQuery and discuss it like a unified tool, as 
opposed to the experiences that it's come to encapsulate for me, I was taken aback 
and excited. Seeing how others learn, understand, and mold jQuery to fit them is 
much of what makes the project so exhilarating. 

I'm not the only one who enjoys jQuery on a level that is far different from a normal 
tool-user relationship. I don't know if I can properly encapsulate why this is, but I've 
seen it time and time again —the singular moment when a user's face lights up with 
the realization of just how much jQuery will help them. 

There is a specific moment where it just clicks for a jQuery user when they realize 
<blockquote>
that this tool that they were using was in fact much more than just a simple tool all 
along</blockquote> — <h1>and suddenly their understanding of how to write dynamic web applications 
completely shifts</h1>. It's an incredible thing and absolutely my favorite part of the 
jQuery project.
