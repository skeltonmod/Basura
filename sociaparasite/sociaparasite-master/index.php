        I'm writing this at 1 AM lmao... also, long intro inbound prepare yourselves for a giant wall of text<br>

        Hey hey it's me nibble or as you might know me from Facebook as Magister
        and gvim80 from somewhere else.

        I'm a Computer Science student hailing from the glorious AMA Computer College of CDO
        I mostly write code with whatever language I can familiarize myself with but I don't consider
        myself as a professional, just intermediate since I have been jumping from one language to another.
        I love game dev, just finished my first game although I don't want to release it anywhere since
        it's supposed to help me familiarize with my new engine of choice - The Godot Engine a robust game engine
        that uses the same style and syntax of, I digress, though I've made a few handful of game projects in the
        past, this current one would be the most semi-ambitious game that I'll ever make when it comes to personal projects
        and as for non-personal project, I've been asked to help out on a few various projects but I'm not allowed to disclose them but
        even if I do, the perfectionism inside you would scream due to the lack of any standardized methods in coding but I'm
        learning some design patterns now so you don't have to worry about anything oh and they are all messy when it comes
        organization.


        This site will be used to log all my activities during and probably after the quarantine.

        As you might have noticed, you got lost in the internet again, either you did a
        quickie scroll on twitter or you just clicked a bunch of sites, whatever it is welcome to my
        micro-blog; here you'll find a wide assortment of posts ranging from what I do most of the time,
        my adventures in coding (if you ever call it that), starting my career in game development (more on this below) and
        all the way to my frustrations with romance.

    <h4>Quick note</h4>
    <p>
        I've been coding for almost 3 years now and it's mostly intermittent as I've been jumping from one language to another
        and today I've finally made the resolve to stick with one language and that is GDScript and Java (I lied about using one language)
        HAHA but for realsies I've been coding whatever project that comes up from either school or personal interest so I made this little
        micro-blog to journal my journey in this wacky world of softwares and IT albeit from a retard's perspective. I'll also be
        documenting what happens when I'm not doing my usual routine, i.e procrastinating and being a disappointment to everyone,
        do note that i'll only be documenting them here when they're actually worth sharing.
    </p>
    <p>
     I'll be updating this often or when my attention deficiency isn't acting up, the first few blogs might probably be
     about the systems I'm working for some Grad student's thesis and I might be also sharing a few key notes about
     this game that i've been prototyping on, though I haven't came up with a title yet. I hope you'd enjoy
     reading this little essay that I've wrote even if it has bad grammar and syntax.
     Links below would redirect you to my social media sites.
